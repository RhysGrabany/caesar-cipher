# Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

Command line program for Linux, not tested with other Operating Systems

This is my best solution to encrypting and decryption based on the Caesar Cipher  
Without using the module that is provided
  
  
Using the enchant module to check if the words are in the UK/US english dictionaries,  
the program will then make it's way through the top 10 most common letters of the english
language, before going through the rest of the alphabet, and uses frequency analysis to decrypt the provided input.
